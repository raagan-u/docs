description: "The Hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a core component of atomic swaps, enabling secure cross-chain transactions. It allows an **initiator** to lock tokens in a contract that can only be claimed by a designated **redeemer** who possesses a cryptographic secret. If the redeemer does not claim the tokens within the specified timeframe, the initiator can reclaim them, ensuring no funds are lost.",

description: "Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin does not have the concept of contracts. Instead, it has scripts. In the following sections, let's explore on how we can implement the functions like `initiate`, `redeem`, `refund` and `instant refund`.",
