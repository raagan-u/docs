# Better price

Garden’s architecture ensures users not only get a competitive price at the time of swap initiation but also have the potential to settle at better prices. By leveraging private off-chain liquidity through [solvers](../introduction/Solvers.md), peer-to-peer matching, and advanced settlement mechanisms like [xCoW](../how-it-works/cross-chain-coincidence-of-wants-xcow.md), Garden dynamically optimizes swaps during execution.

When users initiate a swap, they are shown a minimum guaranteed quote. During settlement, however, Garden’s price improvement capabilities can unlock better pricing.
