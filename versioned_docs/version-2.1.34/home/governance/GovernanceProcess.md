# Governance process

Garden's governance framework was created to solidify our community-first ethos. To participate, one must be an active [staker](../../home/fundamentals/introduction/Stakers.md). The number of governance votes you own is dependent on the staking multiplier, similar to staking rewards.

For example, if you staked 21,000 SEED for 24 months, then your total voting power is 30 votes.

## Proposal process

### Temp check

Before raising a proposal at Garden, it is essential to initiate a Temp Check. This preliminary step allows you to gauge community interest and determine whether there is sufficient support to alter the status quo. Follow these steps to initiate a temp check:

**Engage with community**[**â€‹**](https://docs.garden.finance/home/governance#engage-with-community)

Discuss your idea with community members to gather feedback and understand their perspectives. Choose a platform for your Temp Check. This can be done via:

* **Discord:** Post a message in the #governance channel.
* **X:** Post a tweet or create a poll to gather responses.

**Criteria for moving forward**[**â€‹**](https://docs.garden.finance/home/governance#criteria-for-moving-forward)

* **Discord:** **10+ ðŸ”¼ (up votes)** signals enough interest to proceed for the next step.
* **X:** **10+ likes** on a tweet or **20+ poll responses** signal enough interest to proceed for the next step.

Once temp check is passed the proposal moves to Garden Improvement Proposal (GIP) stage, where gardeners who have staked SEED will formally vote on the proposal via Snapshot.

### Raise a proposal

After your proposal passes the temp check, you can start creating a proposal. A formal proposal marks the transition from idea to action. Proposals have to be submitted for community voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gardenfinance.eth).

In your proposal, clearly state the problem you aim to address and describe the proposed solution in detail. Outline actionable steps required to implement this solution, providing links to any relevant code repositories or resources. Additionally, discuss the expected outcomes, detailing both the potential benefits and any risks. This comprehensive approach ensures the community can make well-informed decisions on each proposal.

Raising a proposal requires a minimum of **500 votes**. Proposers are responsible for finding a community backer with enough votes to sponsor their proposal. These backers often monitor the townhall for promising ideas and may choose to support a proposal based on positive temp check results.

### Community voting

The voting phase lasts for **7 days**, where stakers cast their votes via snapshot. Proposers can use this time to actively engage with the community in the townhall to generate excitement and support for their proposal. Encourage discussions, answer questions, and highlight the benefits of the proposal to motivate community members to participate in the voting process. This period is your opportunity to rally the community's backing and secure the votes needed to move the proposal forward.

### Implementation

Once a proposal achieves a **quorum of at least 6,000 votes**, it is officially passed. The Garden core team will then work with the proposer to ensure effective implementation. This process ensures alignment with Garden's strategic goals and community interests.
