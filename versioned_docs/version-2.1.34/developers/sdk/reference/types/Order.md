## Swap

The Swap type represents the details of a swap transaction on a specific blockchain involved in an atomic swap. Each order in the system has two swaps associated with it:

- Source Swap: Represents the transaction on the initiator's source chain.
- Destination Swap: Represents the transaction on the follower's destination chain.
