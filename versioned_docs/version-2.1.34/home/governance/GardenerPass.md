# Gardener pass

The Gardener pass is an exclusive NFT that provides access to unique benefits and opportunities within the Garden ecosystem.

Initially introduced during the [seasons](https://garden.finance/blog/seasons-intro) program, Gardener pass can now be minted by staking 21,000 SEED perpetually. Each pass offers holders exclusive access to a range of benefits and opportunities within the ecosystem:

* **Permanent staking multiplier:** Pass holders gain a 7x multiplier on their staking rewards.
* **Enhanced governance power:** Staking 21,000 SEED normally gives you 10 governance votes. However, Garden pass holders receive 70 votes because of the 7x multiplier, offering substantial influence in protocol governance and revenue sharing.
* **Tradeability:**  As a fully tradable NFT, the pass can be sold or transferred on [marketplaces](https://opensea.io/collection/gardener-pass). Minting a pass requires permanently staking SEED, effectively burning it, which establishes its inherent value.

You can mint the Gardener Pass by staking **21,000 SEED** indefinitely on the [staking page](../basics/guides/stake/StakeSEED.md).

## What’s next?

As we step into Act 2, the pass becomes more than just a feature—it’s a way to truly be part of Garden’s journey. With it, you’ll get **early access to new features** and **opportunities to participate more deeply** in what we’re building together.

Staking SEED to get the pass isn’t just about governance power or staking rewards. It’s about aligning with Garden’s growth and long-term vision. This ecosystem is owned by the community, and the pass is a **rite of passage** for anyone ready to step up and help steer its direction.

By committing, you’re not just investing—you’re shaping the future alongside us. The value goes beyond rewards—it’s about having a real say in where we go from here.
