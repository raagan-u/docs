# Garden

The `Garden` class serves as a high-level wrapper around the core modules of the system: `quote`, `orderbook`, `secretManager`, and `EVMRelay`. It provides a simplified interface with primary functionalities for creating and executing swaps.

**Key Features**

- Facilitates the creation of new orders through the `swap` method.
- Allows for the execution of orders via the `execute` method.
- Provides access to underlying modules (`quote`, `orderbook`, `secretManager`, and `EVMRelay`) for advanced interactions if needed.

## Usage

```ts
import { Garden } from '@gardenfi/core';
```

## Constructor

```ts
new Garden(config: GardenConfigWithHTLCs): IGardenJS
```

**Parameters:**

- `config` ([GardenConfigWithHTLCs](../types/GardenProps.md)): The configuration object for the Garden instance.

**Returns:**

- [`IGardenJS`](../../Interfaces.md#igardenjs)

---

## Static function

### fromWallets

```ts
static fromWallets(config: GardenConfigWithWallets): Garden
```
The `fromWallets` function lets you initialize the `Garden` instance using wallets instead of HTLCs.

**Parameters:**

- `config` ([GardenConfigWithWallets](../types/GardenProps.md#gardenconfigwithwallets)): The configuration object for the Garden instance.

**Returns:**

- [`IGardenJS`](../../Interfaces.md#igardenjs)

## Methods

### swap

```ts
swap(params: SwapParams): AsyncResult<MatchedOrder, string>
```

The `swap` function creates a new order based on the provided parameters. It validates the input, uses the [secretManager](./secretManager.md) to generate a secret and secret hash using a nonce, which is calculated as the user's number of orders plus one, and fetch attested quote from the [quote](./quote.md) module. After these steps, it posts the order to the [orderbook](./Orderbook.md) to create a new order.

This function simplifies the process of creating a swap by handling validation, secret generation, and order creation automatically.

**Parameters:**

- `params` ([SwapParams](../types/SwapParams.md)): The parameters for creating the swap.

**Returns:**

- [`AsyncResult<MatchedOrder, string>`](../types/Order.md#matchedorder)

### execute

```ts
execute(): Promise<() => void>
```

Executes the pending orders and provides a cancel function to stop the execution.

**Returns:**

- `Promise<() => void>`: A promise that resolves to a function for canceling the execution.

- `action` ([OrderActions](../../Enumerations.md#orderactions)): The type of action that was completed
- `result` (string): Details about the successful operation

### `onPendingOrdersChanged`

Fired whenever the list of pending orders is updated.

**Parameters:**

- `orders` ([OrderWithStatus[]](../types/Order.md#orderwithstatus)): Array of current pending orders with their status
