# How to stake SEED

Participate in the Garden protocol by staking [SEED](https://docs.garden.finance/home/governance/tokenomics). Staking unlocks revenue sharing and [governance](https://docs.garden.finance/home/governance/governance-process) power for you. If you are new, you can buy SEED [here](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=arbitrum&inputCurrency=NATIVE&outputCurrency=0x86f65121804d2cdbef79f9f072d4e0c2eebabc08). This guide explains the staking process and the options available to you.

1. Open Garden's [staking](https://app.garden.finance/stake/) interface and connect your **EVM wallet**.
