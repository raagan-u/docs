# Cross-chain intents

Garden allows users to express any trading intent, regardless of the assets or chains involved, and seamlessly match them with complementary intents across its decentralized network. This flexibility extends beyond single-chain systems, enabling true cross-chain trading, including compatibility with complex Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains like Bitcoin.

Garden’s design supports a broad range of trading intents, whether you’re looking to:

* Swap Bitcoin for Ethereum.
* Exchange niche tokens across chains, such as moving from Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Ethereum to Bonk (BONK) on Solana.
* Complete multi-step trades that involve intermediate assets like USDC.

No matter how specific or complex your trading intent, Garden’s [xCoW mechanism](../how-it-works/cross-chain-coincidence-of-wants-xcow.md) ensures it can be matched efficiently.
