# Tokenomics

SEED is the utility token of Garden and is designed to facilitate participation in the protocol.The token launched on [January 18th, 2024](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x02446e6d65cef97f2a172382179c035bf5cd5738dfc1ba3c01c7f8a8439ec00d).

SEED empowers holders to actively shape the Garden ecosystem:

* **Staking**: [Stake](../../home/fundamentals/introduction/Stakers.md) SEED to participate in protocol governance and earn a share of platform revenue. A minimum of 2,100 SEED are required to stake.
* **Market making**: Holding 210,000 SEED tokens grants eligibility to become a [solver](../../home/fundamentals/introduction/Solvers.md).&#x20;
* **Governance:** Participate in protocol decision-making, have a say in selecting community incentive programs, giving grants, and treasury allocation.
* **Mint and burn:** You can choose to permanently burn 21,000 SEED (perma-stake) to mint a [Gardener pass](./GardenerPass.md). This pass comes with all the benefits of permanently staking seed, and also gives you the flexibility to transfer ownership to a different wallet or put it up for sale as its an NFT.
* **Exclusive access**: SEED holders receive early access to new features, exclusive contests, and other benefits, enriching their engagement within the Garden ecosystem.

### Future Outlook[​](https://docs.garden.finance/home/basics/tokenomics/#future-outlook) <a href="#future-outlook" id="future-outlook"></a>

The SEED allocation for community incentives is dynamic, with the DAO determining its distribution to ensure alignment with community needs. Transparent tokenomics and governance-driven decisions will remain central as Garden evolves. Initiatives to onboard new chief gardeners and enhance community engagement will expand in future phases of the protocol.
