## What is Garden?

Garden is the fastest Bitcoin bridge, enabling cross-chain Bitcoin swaps in as little as 30 seconds. It is built using an intents-based architecture with trustless settlements, ensuring zero custody risk for the users.

With over a billion dollars in volume facilitated, Garden stands apart from other bridges thanks to these [benefits](fundamentals/benefits/Benefits.md).

### Provide​ <a href="#provide" id="provide"></a>

Provide liquidity to Garden and earn fees by becoming a [solver](fundamentals/introduction/Solvers.md) for the Garden protocol. If you are interested, reach out to us in the [townhall](https://discord.com/invite/kqMBgeAKAh) to discuss the next steps.

### Stake <a href="#stake" id="stake"></a>

Garden's [staking](fundamentals/introduction/Stakers.md) system employs a game-theoretic mechanism to ensure solver integrity while incentivizing long-term [**SEED**](governance/Tokenomics.md) commitment through native Bitcoin rewards.
