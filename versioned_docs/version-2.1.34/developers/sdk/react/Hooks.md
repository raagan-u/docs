# useGarden

The `useGarden` hook is a comprehensive, pre-packaged React hook that simplifies the integration of Garden SDK into your dApp. It encapsulates the functionality of both `useOrderbook` and `useDigestKey` while exposing a unified API to handle all core interactions, from order management to secret handling.

import type { GardenContextType } from '@garden/core';
